%p Fuzzy Name Search, Part 2

%p
  Sometimes, ElectricCourage users are in a rush or slightly intoxicated, 
  making their queries even worse than before. Also, most users don't call places 
  by their formal names, and may drop common words like club, pub, the, etc.
  %br
  %br
  You are given: 1. a list of 1000 place names, and 2. a list of 100 search queries and their ids.
  Match each search query to its expected place name, and return the id of the search string and the identified place.
  Your algorithm only has to get 90% of the matches right to pass.

  Like before, except queries may now also:
  %ul
    %li be missing words completely
    %li have words in the wrong order

    The Dojo is our monthly programming contest. <br />
    Have fun, eat, and learning something new; <br />
    you might even win an awesome prize! <br />
  %p
    Our challenges start off easy, but get trickier as the night goes on.
    You can fly solo, or work together and share the spoils.
    And don't worry, you can use any programming language.
  %p
    New coders are welcome! You can partner up and can always take advantage of those around you.
    It won't be easy, but it will be educational and fun!

  %p
    The next dojo is on <em>October 15th</em>. <br /> Come and eat, code, and be merry!

%p Substitution Cipher

%p
  You've been given a block of text that's been encoded with a basic
  substitution cipher - that is, there is a one-to-one mapping between each
  character which you must determine.
%p
  Note that in this case, you may not be able to complete automate the solving
  \- don't discount looking at intermediate output for clues!

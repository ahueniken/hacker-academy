  Hacker Academy is a student community at the University of Toronto. We attract students of common technical interests and promote an environment of curiosity, learning and sharing of knowledge.

  Hacker Academy is not about cultivating black, white, or grey-hat Hackers. We call ourselves Hackers not on the computer security basis but the the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_(programmer_subculture)">Hacker subculture</a>. At Hacker Academy, we live by the ABC of <em>The Hacker Way</em>:

%dt <em>A</em>ttitude: Innovative, clever, and crafty
%dt <em>B</em>oundless: We decide what we do
%dt <em>C</em>ommunity: Sharing technical knowledge, and keeping it open

%p
  Through our weekly <a href="/talks">talks</a> and monthly <a href="/dojo">programming competitions</a>, HA presents members with the opportunity to explore their interests in technology and share their knowledge and expertise with others. We want the builders of future hardware and software systems to have a chance to apply what they are learning in school and stay up to date with what is happening in industry.

  As engineers in training, we believe that it is imperative for students not only perform well academically but also be consistently aware of what is happening in the actually technical/engineering industry. HA provides an environment for students to share technical news, knowledge, and expertise with everyone and anyone that is willing to learn. HAâ€™s goals are:
  %ol
    %li Bring people of common technical and engineering interests together

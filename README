Project Overview:

Hacker Academy is a student club started at the University of Toronto as a community for students passionate about technology to meet each other and share their interests. We run events such as weekly technology talks (usually presented by a member of the club) sharing an area they are passionate about. We also run the occasional programming competitions where we self-design and implement the questions with this website! We've also run hackathons and a few other tech events in the past. If you're looking to start a similar club at your school or community we hope we can help you out. 

The code in this repository is what you see at www.hackeracademy.org and is a Ruby on Rails App with MongoDB served on Heroku. It currently doesn't have tests but we're hoping to improve that soon. 

The main components of the website are: 
1) News Postings
2) A Points, Achievements and Leaderboard system
3) A programming competition (DevDojo) system.

More documentation detailing the DevDojo system will be coming soon.
